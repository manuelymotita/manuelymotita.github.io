    <p> There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground, 
        And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
        And frogs in the pools singing at night,
        And wild plum trees in tremulous white,
        Robins will wear their feathery fire
        Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
        And not one will know of the war, not one
        Will care at last when it is done.
        Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree
        If mankind perished utterly;
        And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,
        Would scarcely know that we were gone. 
          
        Sara Teasdale, 1884 - 1933
